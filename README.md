# Interview Code Challenge

The challenge consists of creating a URL shortener.

Specifically, this is a web server that serves two routes:

* `/shorten`: Submit a url to shorten.
* `/${url}`: Follow a shortened url.

## Requirements

- Details are purposefully kept vague, part of the challenge will be to figure them out.

- We are looking for sustainable engineering practices.

- Bonus points if you have deployed your server somewhere.

## FAQ

1. Q. Can I look things up?

   A. Yes, as much as you want from wherever you want.

2. Q. Which language should I write this in?

   A. Preferably whichever language you have applied to write in, but it matters more that you get something running than that it's written in the "right" language.
